# DiscreteVAE
Experiments with Discrete VAE

* Using Gumbel-Max trick (a soft version)
* Binary VAE: Hashing (Done)
	* Good results show that Binary VAE outperforms Traditional VAE on Hashing
* Categorical VAE: Classes


#### To Do:
* Run experiments on Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV 1)
* NDCG on Reuters -> Analize how the model order the data according to labels
* Use Collocations (n-grams)
* Intrinsec Measure -> Accuracy on labeling the datasets with hidden representation
* Few Bits (4-8-16) -> Analize cells distributions
